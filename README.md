# Inspiration
* Our goal is to help everyone have a safe adventure and have all the tools they need in one app!

# What it does
* Our app has many useful features:
    * Trip Advisor - Search up vacations and places to go.
    * Breadcrumbs - Fear getting lost? Not to fret, this feature logs your current location every x seconds. This will create a direct path to the trail you are on. If you get lost, either find your way back or the maps will point to the closest ranger station to find more help.
    * Plant Identifier - A feature that helps users identify flora in the wild.
    * Packing Checklist - Plans everything from To-dos to items recommended to pack.
    * Advisory - Find out the weather of the places you are going to make sure it is safe.


# How we built it
* We used
    * React Native
    * Javascript
    * Maps
    * Plant.id API
    * Reddit API
    * Trip Advisor API

# Challenges we ran into
* At one point while working on the plant identifier, we could not get the camera to work. Eventually our whole app stopped working. Luckily, we had a backup of the app, which we used, getting our app set back up again.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Getting the Plant Identifier to work
* Getting the Breadcrumbs map tool to work
* Weather displaying
* Amazing intuitive UI throughout our whole app

# What we learned
* How to use the camera package in react native
* How to use APIs
* Time management

# What's next for Adventi
* Improving existing features.
* Publishing it on the App Store and/or the Google Play store (if we win, to help the most people)!
